1.	Introduction

This is a project for Software Engineering course, fall 2014, Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. We are required to create a software requirements specification for an application utilizing indoor positioning system. Our group has chosen a mobile application that would be helpful to exchange students. The name of our application is hobbies mobile application. The application will work hand in hand with Metropolia’s tuubi as the information of the student will be first taken from the tuubi system. The student will be informed of this application on date of orientation. 

Every year, there are hundreds of exchange student come to study at Metropolia. We were first inspired to come up with this idea to help them to have great experiences during their stay. 

The application will help them find and connect to students with similar hobbies. During registration, they can list their interests. The data will be saved on the server and they will be notice about nearby students with similar interests.
