#Project management, self-reflection

The idea of the application took 2 hours. The time that we worked on this project for each person is 6 hours and total is 18 hours.

The projectâ€™s size is good for working in group instead of working separately, so we did all the work in group. Therefore, it is easy to estimate our working hours.

The project is successful in term of learning the documentation and design process. We would be interested in the product if we are exchange students. In next project, we would like to try agile method instead of waterfall.

The most difficult part in the documentation is in developing function requirements. We tried to make our product unique (not just another Facebook wannabe). 

Not satisfy: The documentation and design part really required us to work closely together, therefore we did not utilize github and version control system.
